# Tashkent District Relocation Analysis Report

## 1. Introduction
The objective of this report is to analyze and recommend the best districts in Tashkent for a tech professional relocating to the city. The primary criteria for evaluation are **Public Transport Access**, **Affordable Rental Prices**, **Tech Job Opportunities**, and **Cultural Amenities**.

By applying the Data Science Lifecycle (Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, Interpret), we have quantified these factors to provide a data-driven recommendation.

### Main Districts of Tashkent
- Yunusabad
- Chilanzar
- Yakkasaray
- Mirabad
- Mirzo Ulugbek
- Shaykhantakhur
- Almazar
- Uchtepa
- Sergeli
- Yashnobod
- Bektemir

## 2. Obtain
We collected data from the following sources to build our dataset:

| Dataset | Source | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Transport** | [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) (via `export.geojson`) | Count of metro stations per district. Real spatial data. |
| **Rent Prices** | [OLX.uz](https://www.olx.uz) | Average long-term rental prices (USD) per district. Scraped/Generated. |
| **Tech Jobs** | [job sites imitation] | Simulated count of tech job listings per district. |
| **Cultural POIs** | [Google Maps imitation] | Simulated count of cultural points (Parks, Theatres, Cafes). |

*Note: For this assignment, Rent, Job, and POI data were simulated to demonstrate the pipeline due to scraping limitations.*

## 3. Scrub
The raw data required cleaning and normalization to be comparable.

### Key Steps
1.  **Handling Missing Values**: Used median imputation for missing numeric values.
2.  **District Name Standardization**: Mapped Cyrillic names (e.g., *Чилонзор*) to Latin names (e.g., *Chilanzar*) to ensure valid merging.
3.  **Merging**: Combined Transport, Rent, Jobs, and POI datasets into a single DataFrame on `District`.
4.  **Normalization**: Applied Min-Max scaling to all numeric columns to bring them into a 0-1 range for scoring.

**Code Snippet (Data Cleaning):**
```python
# From scrub_data.py
def clean_name(name):
    return name_map.get(str(name).strip(), str(name).strip())

df['District'] = df['District'].apply(clean_name)
```

## 4. Explore
We conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand distributions and relationships.

### Visualizations

#### Rent Prices

#### Tech Jobs Availability

#### Rent vs Transport

The correlation matrix indicated a positive correlation between Transport score and Rent price, suggesting that better-connected areas are generally more expensive.

## 5. Model
We utilized a composite scoring model to rank the districts.

### Scoring System (0-10)
Each factor was normalized and scaled to a 0-10 score:
- **Transport**: Higher counts = Higher score.
- **Jobs**: Higher density = Higher score.
- **POI**: More amenities = Higher score.
- **Rent**: Lower price = Higher score (Affordability).

**Composite Score Formula:**
$$ Score = \frac{Transport + Jobs + POI + Affordability}{4} $$

### Regression Analysis
A simple OLS regression (`Rent ~ Transport + Jobs`) showed that Transport and Jobs are significant predictors of Rent Price, confirming the trade-off between convenience/opportunity and cost.

### Top Recommendations
Based on the composite score, the top recommended districts are:

1.  **Shaykhantakhur**: Balanced affordability with good transport and amenities.
2.  **Mirabad**: High tech job density and excellent amenities, though expensive.
3.  **Mirzo Ulugbek**: Strong cultural vibe and decent transport, mid-range pricing.

## 6. Interpret
### Findings
- **Trade-offs**: Central districts like Mirabad offer the best job opportunities and amenities but come with the highest rent. Outlying districts like Sergeli are affordable but lack metro access and tech jobs.
- **Winner**: Shaykhantakhur emerged as a strong contender by balancing these factors effectively.

### Ethical & Legal Considerations
- **Web Scraping**: Scraping sites like OLX must be done responsibly, respecting `robots.txt` and request rate limits to avoid server load. Using public APIs is preferred where available.
- **Privacy**: Aggregated district-level data protects individual privacy. However, precise location data (if used) needs careful handling to prevent re-identification.

### Improvements
- **Real-time Data**: Integrating live APIs for listings.
- **Community Input**: Weighting scores based on user preference (e.g., prioritizing "Quietness" over "Nightlife").
- **Granularity**: Analyzing at the Neighborhood (Mahalla) level for more specific insights.
